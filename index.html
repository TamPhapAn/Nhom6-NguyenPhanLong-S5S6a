                Sampson 's research has focused on <br>
                the ecology and evolution of late <br>
                Cretaceous dinosaurs and he has <br>
                conducted fieldwork in a number of <br>
                countries in Africa. <br>

                Scott Sampson is a Canadian-born <br>
                paleontologist who received his Ph.D.in <br>

            <p class="content2">His doctoral work focused on two new <br>
                spcies of ceratopsids, or horned <br>
                dinosaurs, from the Late Cretaceous of <br>
                Montana, as well as the growth and <br>
                 function of certopsid horns and frills. <br>

                 Following graduation in 1993, Sampson <br>
                 spent a year working at the American <br>
                 Museum of Natural History in New York <br>
                 City, followed by five years as assistant <br>
                 professor of anatomy at the New York <br>
                 College of Osteopathic Medicine on <br>
                 Long Island. He arrived at the <br>
                 University of Utah accepting a dual <br>
                 position as assistant professor in the <br>
                 Department of Geology and Geophysics <br>
                 and curator of vertebrate paleontology <br>
                 at the Utah Museum of Natural History. <br>
                 His research interests largely revolve <br>
                 around the phylogenetics, functional <br>
                 morphology, and evolution of Late <br>
                 Cretaceous dinosaurs. <br>

                 In addition to his museum and <br>
                 laboratory-base studies, Sampson has <br>
                 conducted paleontological work in <br>
                 Zimbabwe, South Africa, and <br>
                 Madagascar, as well as the United <br>
                 States and Canada. He was also the <br>
                 on-the-air host for the Discovery <br>
                 Channel's Dinosaur Planet and recently <br>
                 completed a book, <b><i>Dinosaur Odyssey: <br>
                Fossil Threads in the Web of Life,</i></b> <br>
                which is one of the most <br>
                comprehensive surveys of dinosaurs <br>
                and their worlds to date.
